# RAG Content Retriever - Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the RAG Content Retriever codebase to fix issues and enhance stability.

## 1. Connection Management Improvements

### Shared QdrantClient Singleton
- Created a singleton `get_qdrant_client()` function in `config.py` that ensures only one connection to Qdrant is maintained
- Added timeout and retry settings for better stability
- Updated all components to use this shared client instead of creating their own connections

## 2. Error Handling Enhancements

### Robust API Error Handling
- Added a global exception handler in `api.py` to provide consistent error responses
- Added proper try/except blocks with detailed error messages
- Implemented backoff decorators for network operations

### Content Processing Improvements
- Added improved handling for large files that exceed API limits
- Enhanced chunking with better paragraph detection
- Improved document state management

## 3. Health Monitoring

### New Health Check Endpoints
- Added `/health` endpoint for monitoring system health
- Added Kubernetes-compatible `/readiness` and `/liveness` endpoints
- Implemented detailed health status reporting for Qdrant connection

### Qdrant Issue Detection
- Added capability to detect and report Qdrant issues
- Implemented a mechanism to clear issues when needed
- Added robust parsing for different response formats

## 4. Testing Improvements

### Enhanced Test Scripts
- Created `test_local_api.py` for testing the API without external dependencies
- Enhanced `test_api.py` with better error reporting
- Added `specific_search.py` with improved filtering capabilities
- Updated `main.py` test command with detailed output

## 5. Configuration Improvements

### Better Environment Variable Handling
- Enhanced the Config class to properly handle different data types
- Added validation for critical configuration settings
- Improved directory creation for logs and data

## 6. Code Organization

### Reduced Code Duplication
- Centralized shared functionality in appropriate modules
- Improved function modularity and reuse
- Better separation of concerns between modules

## 7. API Enhancements

### New Features
- Enhanced `/dashboard` endpoint with better visualization data
- Improved search capabilities with better filtering
- Added detailed documentation on API endpoints

## 8. Security Improvements

### API Authentication
- Enhanced API key validation
- Added proper security headers
- Protected sensitive endpoints

## Next Steps

1. Consider implementing a caching layer for frequently accessed data
2. Enhance monitoring with Prometheus metrics
3. Implement automated backups of Qdrant data
4. Add more comprehensive test coverage
5. Further optimize embedding and retrieval strategies
