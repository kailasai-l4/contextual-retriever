United States of KAILĀSA: Revival of the
Ancient Enlightened Hindu Civilizational Nation

A Message
From THE SUPREME PONTIFF OF HINDUISM BHAGAWAN SRI NITHYANANDA PARAMASHIVAM
• It is time we enrich the whole humanity
   for dharmic life, the Cosmic law-centric
   lifestyle.
• We need to align ourselves and enrich
   others to align to the enlightened lifestyle.
• Consciousness-centric lifestyle is no more
   a luxury. It is a survival need.
• There are only 2 choices in front of us:
• Either all of us wake up and decide to
   make decisions and policies based on the
   Cosmic principles, revealed in Vedas and
   Āgamas, Consciousness-centric lifestyle,
   enlightened civilizational thought
   currents, so we all coexist. That's a best
   way to exist.
• The other choice; If we don't wake up and
   decide to coexist, the other choice will
   be... nothing will be left.
• It is time we all wake up and decide to
   align our lifestyle, policies, everything,
   centered on Cosmic principles.
• It is time to look beyond our borders as
   the whole global family.
• KAILĀSA's effort is to unite all the nations.
   Uniting all the nations is fundamentally to
   enrich everyone with the highest values.
• Hinduism says very clearly - “ahimsā
   paramo dharmaḥ”. Non-violence is the
   ultimate Cosmic principle. The natural
   law of the Cosmos functions centered on
   ahimsā (non-violence) and coexistence.

*   It is time we all wake up to this truth - ahiṃsā paramo dharmaḥ.

*   We can apply this principle, whether a simple decision of what you eat for your breakfast or the major decisions you make about the relationship, the way to relate with the other countries - external affairs policies, in every level, it is time we bring enlightened principles, Cosmic principles with a global vision.

*   It is time we focus more on right education, more than developing armies. It is time we focus more on researching longevity than biological weapons.

*   KAILĀSA, The Constitution of KAILĀSA, gives fundamental rights to all beings, not just Hindus or not just human beings.

*   All living beings have a right to exist, right to be treated as the manifestation of Paramaśiva (the primordial divinity).

*   The first amendment of KAILĀSA's Constitution, the first amendment is: The right to treat yourself, treat others, to be treated by others as Paramaśiva, God Himself for all beings, not just human beings but for all beings.

*   Let's all decide to respect, revere, honour, accept, coexist with all beings. Not just human beings, with all beings

*   Planet Earth is for animals too, not just for human beings. We human beings need to realize we can't survive on the Planet Earth by eliminating all other species.

*   It is time we wake up and treat all beings with not just human rights, with divine rights.

*   All beings have a right to exist, treat themselves, treat others, to be treated by others as divine - Paramaśiva, Ultimate God Himself, Ultimate itself.

*   It is time we look beyond the ideas of currency, beyond the ideas of army, beyond the ideas of political ideologies, beyond the ideas of political borders, beyond the ideas of religious philosophies.

*   It is time we look at the whole planet earth and all the beings through the Cosmic principles.

*   KAILĀSA is striving to present Cosmic conscious, enlightened principle-centric model communities, ecosystems all over the world.

*   With the blessings of Paramaśiva and the Gods and Goddesses of KAILĀSA, we do have a territory but we are not just territory-centric nation. We are territory-based civilizational nation. The territory is just for us to stay and operate.

*   It is time we all start looking beyond borders.

*   Hindus all over the world, you are all successful. Oh Hindus! You are the richest ethnic minority in every country you have settled down, whether it is United States of America or Canada or U.K. or Australia.

*   It is time you take these Cosmic principles from Vedāgamic Constitution and enrich the whole world.

*   It's time we need to enrich the world, to these Cosmic principles and revive the ancient enlightened civilization.

*   It is not just removing the extreme poverty. It's not just stopping the deforestation. It's not just protecting the animal rights.

*   It is making everyone feel everything is divine.

*   We need to look at everything from the principles of Cosmos.

*   It is time for us to wake up. Let's all resolve, with the grace of Paramaśiva, to stand for the principles He Himself has revealed in Vedas and Āgamas and revive the ancient enlightened civilization and Cosmic principles,

*   Through these Cosmic principles, let's protect Planet Earth, the only home we have, survive, thrive through coexistence - not just tolerance.

*   I sincerely request these lofty ideals, goals, policies, should not be just in books, should come to the real decision making tables.

*   All the statesmen, all the dignitaries, all the influencers in the field of entertainment, like many Hollywood celebrities, and social media influencers - I request all of you, let's be the real change."

Introduction to THE SUPREME PONTIFF OF HINDUISM BHAGAWAN SRI NITHYANANDA PARAMASHIVAM
The Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism (SPH) Jagatguru
Mahasannidhanam (JGM) His Divine Holiness Bhagavān
THE SUPREME PONTIFF OF HINDUISM BHAGAWAN SRI NITHYANANDA PARAMASHIVAM is the Avatar of this day
and age, an incarnation as per Hinduism. Time and
time again, incarnations like Śri Ramachandra Prabhu,
Bhagavān Śri Kṛṣṇa, Swami Narayan, or Ramakrishna
Paramahamsa have come down to bring humanity to a
greater level of conscious awakening. In this same way,
for the breakthrough of this age that we are living in
currently, the Cosmic Super Consciousness has embodied
the human form again through The SPH.
The SPH is the reviver of the Hindu civilizational nation,
KAILĀSA, the only Hindu nation in the world. Entrusted
with this vision from birth itself, The SPH was recognized
as an incarnation by His Gurus, who prepared Him for His
Avatāric mission of reviving KAILĀSA, the Ancient Hindu
Enlightened Civilization. Today, The SPH has revived
all of the dimensions of Hinduism from the powers of
Paramaśiva, to sacred scriptures, to temple rituals, to the
lifestyle for enlightened living.
The SPH has established more than 16,000 KAILĀSA's
around the world to uphold the teachings of Paramaśiva
in the form of temples, paduka mandirs, satsang
centers, Paramaśiva shaka centers, universities, and
Sarvajnapeethas.
The SPH has also revived the Sacred Arts UniverCity,
which has produced 1 million metal deities and distributed
them to KAILĀSA ecosystems all over the world. The SPH
is recognized as the leader of Hinduism with more than
10,000 letters of commendation and recognition for His
work of reviving this nation, from country statesmen,
religious leaders, and noteworthy personalities across
the globe.
The SPH was recognized and received grand coronation
as the successor of 21 ancient Hindu kingdoms, the details
of which we will be presenting in the chapters of this
book. However, outstanding of all The SPH's numerous
contributions is the revival of a Hindu nation, and His
vision for an enlightened civilization.

Introduction to USK
KAILĀSA is the revival of the ancient enlightened Hindu
civilizational nation with its own sovereign territory. It is
the first Sovereign State for all the two billion born and
practicing Hindu diaspora worldwide.
Unlike any other modern nation, the United States
of KAILĀSA (USK) provides a base for the revival,
preservation, and central administration of Hinduism,
similar to the Vatican, which serves as a central
administration hub for the Roman Catholic Church.
The United States of KAILĀSA stands for all the great
values enshrined in the constitution of KAILĀSA, the Vedas
and the Agamas. It is governed by the Sovereign Order of
KAILĀSA, the oldest Governing Body for Hinduism.
The Sovereign Order of KAILĀSA's Nithyananda (SOKN)
is an atypical government, simultaneously functioning as
the supreme governing body of Hinduism and a sovereign
entity under international law. This mirrors the unique
status of The Holy See, which is an atypical government
as well, as it serves as both the supreme governing body
of the Catholic Church and a sovereign entity under
international law.
The ancient enlightened Hindu civilization existed in 56
nations with 200 Hindu Kingdoms, 1700 Hindu provinces,
and 10,000 Hindu traditions. However, centuries of
religious persecution has made Hindus orphaned with no
country representing them. The last Hindu nation to fall
was Nepal in 2007.

The Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism (SPH)
THE SUPREME PONTIFF OF HINDUISM BHAGAWAN SRI NITHYANANDA PARAMASHIVAM is the Head of 21
such ancient Hindu Kingdoms of Hinduism.
The SPH is reviving Hinduism to its full glory
in the United States of KAILĀSA, which stands
for human rights and religious freedom for all
Hindus worldwide, protecting Hindus from
persecution in over 100 countries.

The State Flag
The State flag of the United States of KAILĀSA
has four elements - Nandi, the Paramahamsa
symbol, The SPH's Ananda Gandha image,
and Paramaśiva. It is called as the Ṛṣabha
Dvaja. The form of Paramaśiva in the flag is
His Cosmic form, with 25 heads and 50 hands.
It is the most powerful and ultimate form as
He Himself describes in the Āgamas. In the
flag, The Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism (SPH)
THE SUPREME PONTIFF OF HINDUISM BHAGAWAN SRI NITHYANANDA PARAMASHIVAM is seated in front of
Paramaśiva.
In Sanātana Hindu Dharma (Hinduism), the
deep maroon (kāvi) color is associated with tyāga
(renunciation with right context) and Sanyās. It
is because of the sacred Hindu Sanyās order
(Hindu monastic order) that Sanātana Hindu
Dharma is available to humanity today. Many
sanyasis and sadhus gave their lives protecting
the sacred scriptures, temples, knowledge,
Gurukuls, and deities. Kāvi symbolizes their
sacrifice, commitment, and integrity to Sanātana
Hindu Dharma.
All Kailāsavasis and Hindus all over the world
are welcome to download, print, and hoist the
Ṛṣabha Dvaja to declare your integrity and
support for KAILĀSA – the first Sovereign State
for Hindus (in accordance with your local and
national laws and protocols for flag hoisting).

"Understand, wherever you put this flag,
that space will intensely vibrate with
Paramaśiva's breathing space. Anywhere
you put this KAILĀSA Cosmic flag, Ṛṣabha
Dvaja, Paramaśiva's breathing space will
fill it; Paramaśiva's inner space will fill
it. In your office, home, cars, temples,
everywhere have this KAILĀSA flag. This is
directly approved by Paramaśiva Himself.
It is directly the flag of Paramaśiva. Put
this flag wherever you can, you will see
Paramaśiva's intense breathing space,
blessings, and protection is on you.”

- The Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism
The State Emblem
The State emblem of the United States of KAILĀSA
is that of Lord Paramaśiva and His consort, Devi
Paramaśiva Śakti. Lord Paramaśiva is shown in
His form with 25 heads and 50 hands, with Devi
Paramaśiva Śakti sitting on His lap.
It is in this posture, with Devi sitting on His
lap, that Paramaśiva revealed Āgamas to Devi
Paramaśiva Śakti, the sacred source scriptures
of Sanātana Hindu Dharma, which are the
embodiment of the ultimate truths of life.
