# Qdrant-DB RAG Content Retriever API

A FastAPI-based system for document ingestion, search, and retrieval using Qdrant as a vector database. Supports batch ingestion, query expansion, and collection management.

## Features
- Batch document ingestion with progress tracking
- Embedding and reranking support
- Collection CRUD (create, list, get, delete)
- Query expansion
- Health and status endpoints

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Qdrant running (local or remote)
- Required environment variables in `.env` file (see `.env.example`)
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## API Endpoints & Example Usage

### 1. Health Check
**GET** `/health`

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/health
```

## üîé Filtering Search Results by Document

You can filter search results to only include results from a specific file (by filename or source_path) or any payload field.

Depending on your ingestion logic, the `filename` may be present as a top-level field or nested inside `metadata`.

### 1. Filter by Top-Level `filename` (Recommended)
If your data was ingested after April 2025, or you have re-ingested with the latest code, `filename` is included as a top-level field in the payload. Use:

```json
"filter": {
  "must": [
    { "key": "filename", "match": { "value": "A Garland of Memories - Devotees' Reminiscences of Time Spent With Swamiji_English_processed (1).md" } }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Filter by Nested `metadata.filename`
If your data was ingested before this update, or you want to support both cases, use:

```json
"filter": {
  "must": [
    { "key": "metadata.filename", "match": { "value": "A Garland of Memories - Devotees' Reminiscences of Time Spent With Swamiji_English_processed (1).md" } }
  ]
}
```

**Note:**
- If you re-ingest documents after updating your code, both fields will be present and both filter methods will work.
- For best results and future compatibility, prefer the top-level `filename` approach.

#### Ingestion Logic for Top-Level `filename`
When ingesting documents, the code ensures `filename` is included at the top level of the Qdrant payload:

```python
payload = {
    "text": chunk["text"],
    "metadata": chunk_meta
}
if "filename" in chunk_meta:
    payload["filename"] = chunk_meta["filename"]
```

For more details, see [Qdrant‚Äôs filter documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/filtering/).

### üîç Filter Syntax: What Does `must` Mean?

In the filter object, the `must` field specifies a list of conditions that **all must be satisfied** for a result to match (logical AND). This is based on Qdrant's boolean filtering logic.

- **`must`**: All conditions must be true (AND logic)
- **`should`**: At least one should be true (OR logic)
- **`must_not`**: None should be true (NOT logic)

#### Example: Multiple `must` Conditions

```json
"filter": {
  "must": [
    { "key": "filename", "match": { "value": "file1.md" } },
    { "key": "source", "match": { "value": "test" } }
  ]
}
```
This will only return results where **both** `filename` is `file1.md` **AND** `source` is `test`.

See [Qdrant filtering documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/filtering/) for more advanced options.

## üß™ Testing
- Add tests for the new filter functionality in your search endpoint to ensure correct results.

## Notes
- All endpoints return JSON responses.
- For authentication, set required API keys in your `.env` file as needed.
- For more advanced usage, see the code and expand as needed.
